                Testing conducted by Apple in May 2023 using preproduction Apple Vision Pro units and software. Testing consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video playback, internet browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. Video playback tested in conjunction with an Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app. Internet browsing tested using 20 popular websites. FaceTime tested between two Apple Vision Pro units with Personas enabled. Tested with Wi-Fi associated to a network. Battery life depends on device settings, usage, network, environmental conditions, and many other factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific Apple Vision Pro units; actual results may vary.
